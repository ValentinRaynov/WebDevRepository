I really underestimated how much work, effort and thought would be required to do the assignment. I waited for the last few days until I started it and that was my biggest mistake. I never thought it’d be such a hard task to make those 6 pages.</h13></td>

        <tr>
          <td>
              <h13>When I started I had the mindset of “It’s simple WebDev, Ill get it done for a day or two tops.” Never been more wrong. Assignment hit me like a truck, had to spend a lot of time working on it and missed the initial deadline due to that.</h13>

                However, I do not regret it as it has become a valuable lesson and made me understand the subject better. I also got to spend time with other people that have helped me through it and I don’t believe I would’ve had that chance had I started earlier. So in a way, my procrastination sort of helped me. Either way, now I’m done and I want to go away from the library I’ve spend the last week in.
